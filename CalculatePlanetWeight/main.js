/*
Though an objectâ€™s mass remains consistent throughout the universe, weight is determined by the force of gravity on an object. Since different planets have different gravity, the same object would weigh different amounts on each of those planets! Cool, huh?

Write a function, calculateWeight(). It should:

have two parameters: earthWeight and planet
expect earthWeight to be a number
expect planet to be a string
return a number representing what that Earth-weight would equate to on the planet passed in.
Handle the following cases:
'Mercury' weight = earthWeight * 0.378
'Venus' weight = earthWeight * 0.907
'Mars' weight = earthWeight * 0.377
'Jupiter' weight = earthWeight * 2.36
'Saturn' weight = earthWeight * 0.916
For all other inputs, return 'Invalid Planet Entry. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.'
*/

// Write your function here:
function calculateWeight(earthWeight, planet) {
  let weight;
  if (Number.isInteger(earthWeight) && typeof planet === 'string') {
    if (planet === 'Mercury') {
      weight = earthWeight * 0.378;
      return weight;
    } else if (planet === 'Venus') {
      weight = earthWeight * 0.907;
      return weight;
    } else if (planet === 'Mars') {
      weight = earthWeight * 0.377;
      return weight;
    } else if (planet === 'Jupiter') {
      weight = earthWeight * 2.36;
      return weight;
    } else if (planet === 'Saturn') {
      weight = earthWeight * 0.916;
      return weight;
    } else {
      return 'Invalid Planet Entry. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.';
    }
  } else {
    return 'Please enter a valid number for earth weight and valid string for planet';
  }
}

// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(calculateWeight(100, 'Jupiter')) // Should print 236

// We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!
console.log(calculateWeight('100', 'Jupiter'))
